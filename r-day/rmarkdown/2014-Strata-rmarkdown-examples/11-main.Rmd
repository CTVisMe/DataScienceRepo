title: "A main document with a child document"
output: html_document
---

Some words from the main document, and a code chunk:

```{r}
x = rnorm(10)
```

Then a child document:

```{r child='11-child.Rmd'}
```

Continue the main document. The value of y is `r y`.

You can also call `knit_child()` to knit a child document manually.

```{r include=FALSE}
x = rnorm(500)
out = knitr::knit_child('11-child.Rmd', quiet = TRUE)
```


After we manually knit the child document, the value of y is `r y` now.

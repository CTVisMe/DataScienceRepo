```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(babynames)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggplot2, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

textInput("name", "Name:", value = "Garrett")

names <- reactive({
  filter(babynames, name == input$name)
})
```

Here is a graph of the number of people named `r renderText(input$name)`.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
renderPlot({
  qplot(year, n, data = names(), geom ="line", color = sex) + theme_bw()
})
```

`r renderText(input$name)` was more popular than ever in `r renderText(names()$year[which.max(names()$n)])`. So far, `r renderText(sum(names()$n))` people have been named `r renderText(input$name)`.
